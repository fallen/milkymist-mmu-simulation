Steps to follow to run a simulation of Milkymist MMU project : 

1°) You need to have installed ISE WebPack or at least have a fuse/isim (distributed with ISE WebPack)

In the next lines I will take for granted that you installed Xilinx ISE under /opt/Xilinx/ and that you have ISE 13.4

1°) Clone this repository

	git clone git://github.com/fallen/milkymist-mmu-simulation.git

2°) Source Xilinx settings

	source /opt/Xilinx/13.4/ISE_DS/settings32.sh

3°) Copy ram.data and bios.bin files into working directory

	cp software/ram.data .
	cp software/bios.bin .

4°) Run make

	make

5°) Select wires and regs you want to add to wave window

6°) Start and break the simulation

	Click on "Simulation", then "Restart" and then "Run All"
	Wait for something like 200 000 ns
	Stop the simulation clicking on "Simulation" then "Break"

7°) Look at wave window

	Click on the "Float Window" icone (3 icones left from the "zoom in" icone)
	Zoom out a few times on the wave window

- generating your own bios.bin and ram.data
