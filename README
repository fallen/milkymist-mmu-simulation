Steps to follow to run a simulation of Milkymist MMU project : 

1°) You need to have installed ISE WebPack or at least have a fuse/isim (distributed with ISE WebPack)

In the next lines I will take for granted that you installed Xilinx ISE under /opt/Xilinx/ and that you have ISE 13.4

1°) Clone this repository

	git clone git://github.com/fallen/milkymist-mmu-simulation.git

2°) Source Xilinx settings

	source /opt/Xilinx/13.4/ISE_DS/settings32.sh

3°) Copy ram.data file into working directory

	cp software/ram.data .

4°) Run make

	make

For more advanced things like the following, please refer to README.advanced file : 

- generating your own bios.bin and ram.data
